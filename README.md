# stock_manager
my private stock manager

This project is developed based on 'python'.
'kivy' and 'kivymd' are used to make cross-platform App.

- [kivy](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/intro.html)
- [kibymd](https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.1/)

To build APK, we used 'buildozer'
- [buildozer](https://github.com/kivy/buildozer)

Unfortunately, I failed to build APK with WSL.
I keep facing the problem so I refer to the following [guide](https://brain-nim.tistory.com/9) 

Anyway, this app provides the following functions:
- Current Status
- Budget
- Transaction history
- Editing (test phase)

More features will be added later.
